This Todo Demo App implemented with `react.js`.

I have also another implementation in `Vue.js`, which is implemented in the same concept.

## What is `MITs`
Never feel overwhelmed at work again- the M.I.T. technique. A `Most Important Task (MIT)` is a 
critical task that will create the most significant results. 
Every day, create a list of `two or three M.I.T.s`, and focus on getting them done as soon as 
possible. Keep this list separate from your general to-do list. Read more about [MITs](https://personalmba.com/most-important-tasks/).
